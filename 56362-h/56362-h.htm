<p class="blockquot">Twenty-five characters—ten boys and fifteen
girls—are called for but the entertainment can be given by a smaller
number by eliminating some parts. The play is so arranged that this can
be easily done. No special setting is required. It can be given in any
hall or schoolroom.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><span class="smcap">Time</span>—About forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>COSTUMES</b></p>

<p>These directions are for those who wish special costumes. These are
picturesque and pretty, but not essential. If you do not wish to go to
the trouble of making costumes, many of the children may wear their own
school suits, being distinguished by what they carry—Bo Peep by her
crook, Boy Blue by his horn, etc. Of course, those impersonating the
old women must have long dresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Mother Goose</span> wears a quilted
yellow skirt, about to her ankles, a red, pointed waist, and pannier
overskirt, also of red. The waist has a chemisette of white. Her shoes
are high-heeled, low cut black shoes, with large silver buckles and red
heels. Her stockings are red. Her hair is powdered, and combed in any
old-fashioned way. Her hat is a tall, pointed one, of black, with a red
band. She may have her knitting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman</span>, who lived in a shoe, wears
a rusty black dress, made with a straight, full skirt and a basque. She
has a white apron and kerchief, old-fashioned square bowed glasses (the
frames only, of course), and a white cap, the strings hanging down on
either side. Her powdered hair hangs in little curls on each side of
her face. She carries a large shoe, cut from pasteboard, and covered
with black, which is full to overflowing with dolls. She also has a
bunch of switches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Mother Hubbard</span> wears a red skirt, an
old-fashioned “polonaise” of some flowered material (large figures), a
bib apron, a white kerchief, and either an old-fashioned bonnet, or a
ruffled cap. In either case, the strings are tied primly beneath her
chin. She might carry a bone. She has black mitts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bachelor’s Wife</span> wears a hoop skirt,
and a white dress, the skirt of which is covered with ruffles. The
waist may be made in any way that goes well with the skirt. She has a
white shawl, white mitts, and a white bonnet trimmed with pink ribbon
and rosebuds. This must be bent and soiled by her fall. Her dress must
have a mud-stain or two, and be rather rumpled. She carries a satchel
or carpet bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contrary Mary</span> wears a dress of some
large-flowered goods. The waist is very short and full, the skirt is
straight, and very full, after the Greenaway style, and ends about
half-way between her knees and ankles. It has a low round neck, and
short puffed sleeves. She wears a long string of shells and beads, of
different styles and colors, strung anyhow. She has a ruffled white
apron, which she wears behind, tied in a large bow in front. On one
foot is a white shoe and black stocking, on the other a black shoe and
white stocking. On one hand is a long black mitt, on the other, a tan
glove. She has a cap on, with the visor behind. One side of her hair is
in curls, the other in a braid. She may carry a watering pot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Milk Maid</span> wears a dress of pink print or gingham, with
the neck cut in a narrow, deep square outline, and edged with a narrow
white frill. She has a white bib apron. Her sleeves are rolled above
her elbows, and her dress and apron are folded smoothly up and pinned
to display a green striped petticoat. She wears white stockings,
low black shoes, a coquettish little white sunbonnet, and carries a
three-legged milking-stool and a dented pail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curly Locks</span> has a white ruffled dress, a pink sash and
shoulder ribbons, pink stockings, white shoes, and carries a pink sofa
cushion to sit on. She may also have a thimble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dingty Diddlety</span> wears a hoop-skirt, and a dress
of some material with very large figures. It has a straight, full skirt,
gathered on to a plain waist with very full bishop sleeves, gathered
into a narrow wristband, which fastens with one button. She has a round
collar of lace or linen. At her left side hangs a large outside pocket,
or bag. Her hair is parted, combed smoothly down on each side to hide
the ears, and gathered into a knot low in the neck. Pin the collar with
a large round or oval brooch. Her sleeves and pocket are filled with
“gombobbles.” These are made by covering balls of wadding or crumpled
tissue paper with orange-colored crepe paper. The “gombobbles” should
be the size of small oranges, somewhat flatter. Have as many as her
sleeves and pocket will hold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross Patch</span> wears a short-sleeved red
dress, and a full gathered pinafore of red and white print, made after
the fashion of the pinafores so commonly worn in England. She wears a
sunbonnet of red and white checked gingham, which she takes off, and
swings crossly, occasionally. Sometimes she pulls up her apron, and
sulks into that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Blue</span> wears an Empire dress of blue,
blue stockings, and white shoes. A blue ribbon passes around the very
short waist of her dress, and is tied at the left side of the front in
four short loops and two long ends which fall to the hem of the skirt.
The elbow sleeves are tied around with blue ribbons, as is her hair.
She may wear a large hat of shirred blue mull, or no hat, as preferred.
When she enters, one shoe is missing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jill</span> wears a gingham dress, with a
long-sleeved print “tier.” One elbow of this is noticeably patched,
the other has a good-sized hole. The tier is trimmed at neck, wrists
and bottom with ruffles of the print, which are torn and dangling here
and there. It has ties, one of which is ripped off, but hangs with the
other in a limp, stringy bow. The back is decorated with a large grass
stain; the front by an earth stain and a “barn-door” tear. Her hair
hangs loose and tumbled, with no hair ribbon. Her feet are bare. If for
any reason the bare feet are not liked, her shoes must be well worn,
and her stockings torn. A torn petticoat should show a bit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bo Peep</span> wears a short, quilted skirt of blue, with a waist
and overskirt of white, flowered with blue. The low, square neck, full
elbow sleeves, and overskirt are edged with frills of the goods. The
overskirt is looped up over the quilted skirt with blue ribbon bows.
She has a large leghorn “flat,” trimmed with forget-me-nots or daisies,
tied down, gipsy fashion, with blue ribbon. She carries a long crook,
covered with silver paper, with a large blue bow tied just below the
crooked part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Muffett</span> wears a pink dress, with
a thin white overdress, with low, round neck and elbow sleeves. The
neck, sleeves and bottom of over-slip are edged with ruffles. The slip
is caught up a little to show the pink skirt. High under her arms is
a broad pink sash, tied in a big bow behind. She has a full mob-cap
of the white over pink, with a wired frill, and a pink ribbon passing
around crown, and tied in a bow at side or front. Her stockings are
pink or white, her shoes white. She carries a spoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock-a-bye-Baby</span> wears a short white dress
with a yoke, short white socks, and slippers. Her short sleeves are
tied up with ribbons of baby blue, and she may wear a broad sash of
the same color. She has a white lawn baby bonnet, with broad ties. She
carries a Teddy Bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Bunting</span> is dressed like Rock-a-bye
Baby, with pale pink ribbons instead of blue. When she comes in, she
wears a coat and bonnet of white bearskin, but as these are too warm
to keep on long, Mother Hubbard may help her to remove them before she
sits down with Rock-a-bye Baby. She carries a toy rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bachelor</span> wears an old-fashioned suit,
with long coat, knee breeches, and a ruffled bosom shirt. He has white
stockings, low shoes with big buckles, and a tall hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> wears a checked gingham shirt, and
blue overalls, which bear witness to the fact that he “has fallen
into a mud-puddle, flat.” His overalls are rolled up above his knees,
and his feet are bare. There should be a patch or two, also a tear,
somewhere about him. A battered straw hat is on the back of his head,
his hair is uncombed, and he is none too clean. He and Jill have a
battered pail. Jack has it when he enters, but Jill has it part of the
time, and sometimes they swing it between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy Tucker</span> wears gray knickerbockers, a
blue Norfolk jacket, blue stockings and cap, and gray belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgie Porgie</span> wears a brown Greenaway
suit, with long trousers buttoned over a short tight waist, in what
used to be known as a “broadfall.” He has a white frill collar. He
carries a large cloth spider by a string.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy Blue</span> wears a blue sailor blouse, blue
knickerbockers, a leather belt, to which his horn is fastened by a
cord, and a large haymaker’s hat, with a blue band.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span> is the fattest boy
obtainable. He wears a blouse and knickerbockers of red, padded well.
Pad his stockings, also, and make him look as round and fat as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Horner</span> wears a gingham “tier” and
white frill collar over his trousers in the fashion of little boys of
thirty or forty years ago. His trousers come half-way to his ankles,
but the tier stops at the knees. It has a strap across the back, and is
often below the strap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simple Simon</span> wears a carter’s smock frock
of brown jean or linen, not too clean, with long loose trousers of the
same material. The frock comes to his knees. His hair is mussed. He is
eating a pie, which he carries in both hands, with no plate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom, the Piper’s Son</span>, wears a Greenaway
suit of gray, with a short round jacket of dark red, and a white
turn-down collar. His stockings and cap are red. He carries his pipe, a
toy flute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wee Willie Winkie</span> wears his
“nightgown”—one of the sleeping garments cut with legs, in either
white or colored outing flannel. This may have feet, or he may wear
bed slippers. Better still, he may have his feet bare. Choose a small,
mischievous boy for this part.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Impress each child with the character he is supposed to bear, and have
him act it out all the time he is on the stage. The old women pronounce
their words in an old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Mother Goose and Mother Hubbard may knit, the Old Woman tend her
babies, Jack and Jill nudge and push one another, or tease others.
Miss Muffett sulks, Cross Patch strikes at the boys who tease her,
etc. The Bachelor occasionally tries to join some group, but is always
brought back by his wife, who lectures him in pantomime. Tom Tucker
is all taken up with the Milk Maid. Simon, when not eating, stares,
open-mouthed, and backs away from Jack Horner, who is inclined to fight
with him. Once in a while, Georgie scares one of the girls with his
spider. Contrary Mary refuses to be scared, and tries to catch the
spider. Occasionally she waters some one with her watering pot. All
this should be in pantomime.</p>

<p>The songs, except where otherwise stated, are sung by all on the stage,
except the one they are sung <i>at</i>. The piano should not be in evidence,
but just accompany the children to help them keep the tune.</p>

<p>If given in a schoolroom with no curtain, they may all run out after
the final “yell.”</p>

<p>The tunes are easily learned by rote, in fact, many of them will
be familiar to the children. They can be sung nicely without
accompaniment, if given in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Many of the little boys’ suits worn just now are charmingly
picturesque, and have a quaint, old-fashioned air, fitting them
perfectly to be “Mother Goose Costumes.”</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot">An Entertainment in One Scene by Jessie A. Kelley.
Twenty-two males and twenty females are called for, but one person
may take several parts and some characters may be omitted. The stage
is arranged as a country store and post-office in one. Costumes are
rural and funny. Plays a full evening. Full of “good lines” and comical
incident and character. Strongly recommended for church entertainments
or general use; very wholesome and clean.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Price, 25 cents</i><span class="ws8">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="f120 space-above1"><b>MISS FEARLESS &amp; CO.</b></p>

<p class="blockquot">A Comedy in Three Acts by Belle Marshall Locke.
Ten females. Scenery, two interiors; costumes, modern. Plays a full
evening. A bright and interesting play full of action and incident. Can
be strongly recommended. All the parts are good. Sarah Jane Lovejoy,
Katie O’Connor and Euphemia Addison are admirable character parts, and
Miss Alias and Miss Alibi, the “silent sisters,” offer a side-splitting
novelty.</p>

<p class="blockquot">A Comedy in Three Acts by Evelyn Gray Whiting.
Four males, seven females. Scene, an interior; costumes, modern. A
domestic comedy looking steadfastly at the “bright side” of human
