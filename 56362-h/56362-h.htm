<p class="blockquot">Twenty-five characters—ten boys and fifteen
girls—are called for but the entertainment can be given by a smaller
number by eliminating some parts. The play is so arranged that this can
be easily done. No special setting is required. It can be given in any
hall or schoolroom.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>COSTUMES</b></p>

<p>These directions are for those who wish special costumes. These are
picturesque and pretty, but not essential. If you do not wish to go to
the trouble of making costumes, many of the children may wear their own
school suits, being distinguished by what they carry—Bo Peep by her
crook, Boy Blue by his horn, etc. Of course, those impersonating the
old women must have long dresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Mother Goose</span> wears a quilted
yellow skirt, about to her ankles, a red, pointed waist, and pannier
overskirt, also of red. The waist has a chemisette of white. Her shoes
are high-heeled, low cut black shoes, with large silver buckles and red
heels. Her stockings are red. Her hair is powdered, and combed in any
old-fashioned way. Her hat is a tall, pointed one, of black, with a red
band. She may have her knitting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman</span>, who lived in a shoe, wears
a rusty black dress, made with a straight, full skirt and a basque. She
has a white apron and kerchief, old-fashioned square bowed glasses (the
frames only, of course), and a white cap, the strings hanging down on
either side. Her powdered hair hangs in little curls on each side of
her face. She carries a large shoe, cut from pasteboard, and covered
with black, which is full to overflowing with dolls. She also has a
bunch of switches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Mother Hubbard</span> wears a red skirt, an
old-fashioned “polonaise” of some flowered material (large figures), a
bib apron, a white kerchief, and either an old-fashioned bonnet, or a
ruffled cap. In either case, the strings are tied primly beneath her
chin. She might carry a bone. She has black mitts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bachelor’s Wife</span> wears a hoop skirt,
and a white dress, the skirt of which is covered with ruffles. The
waist may be made in any way that goes well with the skirt. She has a
white shawl, white mitts, and a white bonnet trimmed with pink ribbon
and rosebuds. This must be bent and soiled by her fall. Her dress must
have a mud-stain or two, and be rather rumpled. She carries a satchel
or carpet bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contrary Mary</span> wears a dress of some
large-flowered goods. The waist is very short and full, the skirt is
straight, and very full, after the Greenaway style, and ends about
half-way between her knees and ankles. It has a low round neck, and
short puffed sleeves. She wears a long string of shells and beads, of
different styles and colors, strung anyhow. She has a ruffled white
apron, which she wears behind, tied in a large bow in front. On one
foot is a white shoe and black stocking, on the other a black shoe and
white stocking. On one hand is a long black mitt, on the other, a tan
glove. She has a cap on, with the visor behind. One side of her hair is
in curls, the other in a braid. She may carry a watering pot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Milk Maid</span> wears a dress of pink print or gingham, with
the neck cut in a narrow, deep square outline, and edged with a narrow
white frill. She has a white bib apron. Her sleeves are rolled above
her elbows, and her dress and apron are folded smoothly up and pinned
to display a green striped petticoat. She wears white stockings,
low black shoes, a coquettish little white sunbonnet, and carries a
three-legged milking-stool and a dented pail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curly Locks</span> has a white ruffled dress, a pink sash and
shoulder ribbons, pink stockings, white shoes, and carries a pink sofa
cushion to sit on. She may also have a thimble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dingty Diddlety</span> wears a hoop-skirt, and a dress
of some material with very large figures. It has a straight, full skirt,
gathered on to a plain waist with very full bishop sleeves, gathered
into a narrow wristband, which fastens with one button. She has a round
collar of lace or linen. At her left side hangs a large outside pocket,
or bag. Her hair is parted, combed smoothly down on each side to hide
the ears, and gathered into a knot low in the neck. Pin the collar with
a large round or oval brooch. Her sleeves and pocket are filled with
“gombobbles.” These are made by covering balls of wadding or crumpled
tissue paper with orange-colored crepe paper. The “gombobbles” should
be the size of small oranges, somewhat flatter. Have as many as her
sleeves and pocket will hold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross Patch</span> wears a short-sleeved red
dress, and a full gathered pinafore of red and white print, made after
the fashion of the pinafores so commonly worn in England. She wears a
sunbonnet of red and white checked gingham, which she takes off, and
swings crossly, occasionally. Sometimes she pulls up her apron, and
sulks into that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Blue</span> wears an Empire dress of blue,
blue stockings, and white shoes. A blue ribbon passes around the very
short waist of her dress, and is tied at the left side of the front in
four short loops and two long ends which fall to the hem of the skirt.
The elbow sleeves are tied around with blue ribbons, as is her hair.
She may wear a large hat of shirred blue mull, or no hat, as preferred.
When she enters, one shoe is missing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jill</span> wears a gingham dress, with a
long-sleeved print “tier.” One elbow of this is noticeably patched,
the other has a good-sized hole. The tier is trimmed at neck, wrists
and bottom with ruffles of the print, which are torn and dangling here
and there. It has ties, one of which is ripped off, but hangs with the
other in a limp, stringy bow. The back is decorated with a large grass
stain; the front by an earth stain and a “barn-door” tear. Her hair
hangs loose and tumbled, with no hair ribbon. Her feet are bare. If for
any reason the bare feet are not liked, her shoes must be well worn,
and her stockings torn. A torn petticoat should show a bit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bo Peep</span> wears a short, quilted skirt of blue, with a waist
and overskirt of white, flowered with blue. The low, square neck, full
elbow sleeves, and overskirt are edged with frills of the goods. The
overskirt is looped up over the quilted skirt with blue ribbon bows.
She has a large leghorn “flat,” trimmed with forget-me-nots or daisies,
tied down, gipsy fashion, with blue ribbon. She carries a long crook,
covered with silver paper, with a large blue bow tied just below the
crooked part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Muffett</span> wears a pink dress, with
a thin white overdress, with low, round neck and elbow sleeves. The
neck, sleeves and bottom of over-slip are edged with ruffles. The slip
is caught up a little to show the pink skirt. High under her arms is
a broad pink sash, tied in a big bow behind. She has a full mob-cap
of the white over pink, with a wired frill, and a pink ribbon passing
around crown, and tied in a bow at side or front. Her stockings are
pink or white, her shoes white. She carries a spoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock-a-bye-Baby</span> wears a short white dress
with a yoke, short white socks, and slippers. Her short sleeves are
tied up with ribbons of baby blue, and she may wear a broad sash of
the same color. She has a white lawn baby bonnet, with broad ties. She
carries a Teddy Bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Bunting</span> is dressed like Rock-a-bye
Baby, with pale pink ribbons instead of blue. When she comes in, she
wears a coat and bonnet of white bearskin, but as these are too warm
to keep on long, Mother Hubbard may help her to remove them before she
sits down with Rock-a-bye Baby. She carries a toy rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bachelor</span> wears an old-fashioned suit,
with long coat, knee breeches, and a ruffled bosom shirt. He has white
stockings, low shoes with big buckles, and a tall hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> wears a checked gingham shirt, and
blue overalls, which bear witness to the fact that he “has fallen
into a mud-puddle, flat.” His overalls are rolled up above his knees,
and his feet are bare. There should be a patch or two, also a tear,
somewhere about him. A battered straw hat is on the back of his head,
his hair is uncombed, and he is none too clean. He and Jill have a
battered pail. Jack has it when he enters, but Jill has it part of the
time, and sometimes they swing it between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy Tucker</span> wears gray knickerbockers, a
blue Norfolk jacket, blue stockings and cap, and gray belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgie Porgie</span> wears a brown Greenaway
suit, with long trousers buttoned over a short tight waist, in what
used to be known as a “broadfall.” He has a white frill collar. He
carries a large cloth spider by a string.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy Blue</span> wears a blue sailor blouse, blue
knickerbockers, a leather belt, to which his horn is fastened by a
cord, and a large haymaker’s hat, with a blue band.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span> is the fattest boy
obtainable. He wears a blouse and knickerbockers of red, padded well.
Pad his stockings, also, and make him look as round and fat as possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Horner</span> wears a gingham “tier” and
white frill collar over his trousers in the fashion of little boys of
thirty or forty years ago. His trousers come half-way to his ankles,
but the tier stops at the knees. It has a strap across the back, and is
often below the strap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simple Simon</span> wears a carter’s smock frock
of brown jean or linen, not too clean, with long loose trousers of the
same material. The frock comes to his knees. His hair is mussed. He is
eating a pie, which he carries in both hands, with no plate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom, the Piper’s Son</span>, wears a Greenaway
suit of gray, with a short round jacket of dark red, and a white
turn-down collar. His stockings and cap are red. He carries his pipe, a
toy flute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wee Willie Winkie</span> wears his
“nightgown”—one of the sleeping garments cut with legs, in either
white or colored outing flannel. This may have feet, or he may wear
bed slippers. Better still, he may have his feet bare. Choose a small,
mischievous boy for this part.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Impress each child with the character he is supposed to bear, and have
him act it out all the time he is on the stage. The old women pronounce
their words in an old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Mother Goose and Mother Hubbard may knit, the Old Woman tend her
babies, Jack and Jill nudge and push one another, or tease others.
Miss Muffett sulks, Cross Patch strikes at the boys who tease her,
etc. The Bachelor occasionally tries to join some group, but is always
brought back by his wife, who lectures him in pantomime. Tom Tucker
is all taken up with the Milk Maid. Simon, when not eating, stares,
open-mouthed, and backs away from Jack Horner, who is inclined to fight
with him. Once in a while, Georgie scares one of the girls with his
spider. Contrary Mary refuses to be scared, and tries to catch the
spider. Occasionally she waters some one with her watering pot. All
this should be in pantomime.</p>

<p>The songs, except where otherwise stated, are sung by all on the stage,
except the one they are sung <i>at</i>. The piano should not be in evidence,
but just accompany the children to help them keep the tune.</p>

<p>If given in a schoolroom with no curtain, they may all run out after
the final “yell.”</p>

<p>The tunes are easily learned by rote, in fact, many of them will
be familiar to the children. They can be sung nicely without
accompaniment, if given in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Many of the little boys’ suits worn just now are charmingly
picturesque, and have a quaint, old-fashioned air, fitting them
perfectly to be “Mother Goose Costumes.”</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
